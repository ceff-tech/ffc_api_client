# Simple Functional Flows Calculator API client
This package is designed to:
1. Process data through the online functional flows calculator
2. Transform that data and return plots of the Dimensionless Reference Hydrograph (DRH) as well as boxplots showing
  the observed versus predicted percentile values for each metric.
3. Have shortcut functions that handle all of this, while exposing the internals so you can access useful intermediate
  products, such as the functional flows calculator results as an R dataframe, in case you need to do more
  complex analysis.
  
It is meant to be used with simply a gage ID, or with a timeseries dataframe of flows along with either a stream
segment COMID or longitude and latitude (it will look up the COMID for you). See Setup and Examples below for more.

## Full Documentation
There are many examples below, including instructions on how to set up and use the core parts of the package.
However, full documentation of the package is included only in the [online documentation](https://ceff-tech.github.io/ffc_api_client/reference/index.html) or in the [PDF manual](./manuals/ffcAPIClient_latest.pdf).

## Setup
1. If you don't already have `devtools` installed, run `install.packages('devtools')`
in your R console, or install the package any way you prefer.
2. Install this package with `devtools::install_github('ceff-tech/ffc_api_client/ffcAPIClient')`. If you get an error on this installation step, make sure you are using the latest version of the devtools package.
3. Now we need to retrieve your token. In Firefox or Chrome, log into https://eflows.ucdavis.edu. Once logged in, make sure you are on your user profile page at https://eflows.ucdavis.edu/profile and then press F12 on your keyboard to bring up the Inspector, then switch to the Console tab.
4. In the console, type `localStorage.getItem('ff_jwt')` - you may need to type it in yourself instead of pasting (or follow Firefox's
instructions to enable pasting - it will tell you how after you try to paste). Hit Enter to send the command. 
5. Your browser will place text on the line below the command you typed - this is your "token". Save this value and copy it to your clipboard and we'll use it below. This value should stay private - if other people knew the value, they could use it to access your account on eflows.ucdavis.edu!

That's it. You can now run data through the online FFC using this package and process the results.

## Usage Examples

### Following the CEFF Steps

#### Step One
```r
library(ffcAPIClient)

ffc <- FFCProcessor$new()  # make a new object we can use to run the commands

# configure the object and run CEFF step 1 plus outputs

ffc$step_one_functional_flow_results(gage_id=11336000,
     token=token,
     output_folder = "C:/Users/myusername/Downloads/test")
```
That command will output DOH data + image, observed annual data, observed percentiles, and observed plots to the specified folder. It will output the percentiles to the console as well.

It also makes that data available for further analysis on the object `ffc`, so you can now access the FFC results by year as `ffc$ffc_results`, the processed percentiles as `ffc$ffc_percentiles`, and the underlying DOH data as `ffc$doh_data` if you want to view them again in R or feed them into other code and visualizations.

It is highly recommended that you provide the `output_folder` parameter, as the package will also output its log file there, in addition to plots and CSV results. The log will help track the history of the results in case of future changes.

#### Step Two
For step 2, we now run simply `ffc$step_two_explore_ecological_flow_criteria()` and it continues where we left off. In fact, *everything* is run in step 1, and we just control what is output with these functions. This outputs the predicted metric percentile data as a CSV and to the console, and plots the predicted values on their own.

Now we can access `ffc$predicted_percentiles` if we want to feed that into other processing or visualizations too.

#### Step Three
For step 3, same thing. Run `ffc$step_three_assess_alteration()` and get the alteration data frame saved as a CSV and printed to the console. Full comparison plots of predicted vs. observed percentiles are output now to the screen and to the folder specified in step 1 (where everything is saved). 

And now we get one more thing we can access - `ffc$alteration` contains the alteration assessment results. In fact everything is accessible after step 1, but conceptually, this is the data frame that corresponds with this step.

There's also more that's available as part of the `ffc` object, but we'll document that elsewhere.


### Other examples
It's recommended you run the steps above on your own, but the package includes other ways to run similar workflows for gage data
or for timeseries data of your own.
```r
# If you have a gage and a token, you can get all results simply by running
ffcAPIClient::evaluate_gage_alteration(gage_id = 11427000, token = "your_token", comid = segment_comid, plot_output_folder = "C:/Users/youruser/Documents/NFA_Gage_Alteration")
# output_folder is optional. When provided, it will save plots there. It will show plots regardless.
# in the past, we looked up the comid for you, but it's error prone - see function documentation for details
# and how to optionally re-enable the lookup.

# If you have a data frame with flow and date fields that isn't a gage, you can run
ffcAPIClient::evaluate_alteration(timeseries_df = your_df, token = "your_token", plot_output_folder = "C:/Users/youruser/Documents/Timeseries_Alteration", comid=yoursegmentcomid)
# it also *REQUIRES* you provide either a comid argument with the stream segment COMID, or both
# longitude and latitude arguments.
# If your dates are in a different format, provide the format string as argument date_format_string

```
Both of these functions plot results immediately and optionally save the plots to the output folder. They
also return a FFCProcessor object that has items named `ffc_results_df`, `percentiles`, and `drh`, so you can access the transformed
data directly for additional calculations, in addition to other available data.
* `ffc_results` includes the raw data from the functional flows calculator for each flow metric by 
   day of water year. 
* `ffc_percentiles` includes the calculated 10th, 25th, 50th, 75th, and 90th percentiles for each metric
* `alteration` data frame includes the assessed alteration of each metric using CEFF Appendix F Rules.
* `predicted_percentiles` includes the same percentiles as predicted for each metric for assessing the observed ffc
    results against predicted unaltered flow.
* `drh_data` contains the raw DRH data with columns for percentiles and rows for days of water year.

See the [documentation](#documentation) for more information on these results.

## Predicted Flow Metrics
This package compares the percentiles generated from the observed data
and the percentiles predicted by modeling. As part of this functionality, the code includes the full results
of the modeling output as a data frame accessible in `ffcAPIClient::flow_metrics`. More practically,
if you have a variable `com_id` that stores an NHD stream segment identifier (COMID), then you
can also use `ffcAPIClient::get_predicted_flow_metrics(com_id)` to retrieve a data frame with
only the results for that segment. For example, for the Goodyear's Bar reference gage
segment on the North Yuba:
```
